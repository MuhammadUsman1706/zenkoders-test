IMPORTANT NOTES
• I've given my best to prepare the code, but with the limited time available due to my university and office responsibilities, it might not meet all the standards of perfection or best practices (for now).
• The Chat-GPT API implementation has been completed; however, it currently lacks the necessary API key due to it not being freely available. I have made an attempt to seek clarification and obtain the key through email, but regrettably, I have not received a response.
FEATURES OF THE APPLICATION
• Complete Authentication (Login and Sign Up) using Firebase Authentication System with session maintenance.
• Payment Gateway (Stripe) application with multiple subscription ids, for a month, 6 months, and a yearly plan.
• News API call on the server side with 10 seconds revalidation.
• Chat GPT API implementation for news summarization without the required key.
• Completely Responsive Design.
STARTING THE APPLICATION
• Open directory of the code.
• Run npm install on cmd and then npm run dev.
• Note: Application was made on Node v18.18.0.
INSTRUCTIONS
